# Node.js Upgrade Guide

## Current Status

- **Current Version**: v20.12.0
- **Recommended Version**: v20.19+ or v22.12+
- **App Status**: ✅ Running perfectly (warning is non-critical)

## Why Upgrade?

The Vite build tool recommends Node.js 20.19+ for optimal performance, but the app works fine with 20.12.0. The upgrade is optional but recommended for:
- Better performance
- Latest security patches
- Full Vite feature support
- No warning messages

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Your app is running perfectly right now at http://localhost:5173/**

The Node.js version warning is informational only and does NOT prevent the app from working. You can use the app as-is without any issues.

## Upgrade Options

### Option 1: Homebrew (Easiest - Recommended)

If you have Homebrew installed:

```bash
# Check if Homebrew is installed
brew --version

# If not installed, install it:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Upgrade Node.js
brew upgrade node

# Verify new version
node --version
```

### Option 2: Official Node.js Installer

1. Visit https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS version (currently v22.x or v20.19+)
3. Run the installer
4. Restart your terminal
5. Verify: `node --version`

### Option 3: nvm (Node Version Manager)

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Restart terminal or source profile
source ~/.bash_profile  # or ~/.zshrc

# Install latest LTS
nvm install --lts

# Use it
nvm use --lts

# Verify
node --version
```

### Option 4: n (Simple Node Version Manager)

```bash
# Install n globally (may need sudo)
sudo npm install -g n

# Install latest LTS
sudo n lts

# Verify
node --version
```

## After Upgrading

1. Restart your development server:
```bash
cd /Users/jaimebourne/csf-assessment-pro

# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Or kill the process

# Restart
npm run dev
```

2. Verify the warning is gone - you should see:
```
VITE v7.1.12  ready in XXXms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

No more Node.js version warning! ✅

## If You Don't Want to Upgrade

**That's completely fine!** 

Your app works perfectly with Node.js v20.12.0. The warning is just a recommendation, not a requirement. You can:

1. Ignore the warning (app works fine)
2. Upgrade later when convenient
3. Continue development without any issues
