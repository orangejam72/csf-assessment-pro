## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Can't reach this page" or "Unable to connect"

**Solution 1: Check the Server**
The server should be running in your terminal. Look for:
```
VITE v7.1.12  ready in 111 ms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**Solution 2: Restart the Server**
```bash
# In terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then run:
cd /Users/jaimebourne/csf-assessment-pro
npm run dev
```

### Problem: Blank Page

**Solution 1: Hard Refresh (MOST LIKELY FIX)**
Clear your browser cache and reload:
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

This forces the browser to reload the fixed JavaScript code.

**Solution 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Share those errors if you need help

### Problem: Port Already in Use

If you see an error about port 5173:
```bash
# Kill the process on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Restart
npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ Server Confirmation

- ‚úÖ Port 5173 is listening
- ‚úÖ Process ID 74768 is active

---

## üí° Quick Test

```

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If you still can't see it after trying the steps above:

1. **Share what you see**: 
   - Is the browser showing an error?
   - Is the page completely blank?
   - Is something else showing?

2. **Check your browser**:
   - Try a different browser
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Try incognito/private mode

3. **Verify the URL**:
   - Make sure it's `localhost` not `127.0.0.1`
   - Make sure it's port `5173` not `5174` or `3000`
   - Make sure it starts with `http://` not `https://`

## üéâ Expected Result

You should see a professional-looking web application with:
- Clean blue and white design
